## Deployment Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Cloudflare Images Binding Configuration
- **Date**: August 20, 2025

- **Resolution**: Changed binding type to lowercase "images"
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Missing R2 Buckets
- **Date**: August 20, 2025
- **Problem**: Worker deployment failed with "R2 bucket not found"
- **Root Cause**: Required R2 buckets didn't exist
- **Resolution**: Created missing buckets using wrangler CLI
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Asset Deployment**:
   - Upload template assets to R2 buckets
   - Verify all assets are accessible
   - Test template functionality in application

2. **Configure DNS and Routing**:
   - Set up custom domains in Cloudflare dashboard
   - Configure routing rules for API and frontend
   - Verify SSL certificate provisioning

3. **Perform End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Verify frontend functionality
   - Check image generation workflow
   - Validate template selection and usage

4. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document final deployment status
   - Record any additional issues encountered
   - Update user guides and README files

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered complete when:
- ✅ Backend worker accessible at api.quoteviral.online
- ✅ Frontend accessible at quoteviral.online
- ✅ Template assets uploaded and accessible
- ✅ All API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Image generation working end-to-end
- ✅ SSL certificates active for both domains
- ✅ Health monitoring showing all services operational

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Use `wrangler versions view` to see deployed versions
2. Use `wrangler versions deploy` to rollback to previous version
3. Document issue and resolution steps
4. Investigate root cause before attempting redeployment
