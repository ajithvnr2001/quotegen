## Key URLs

### Current Access Points
- **API Endpoint**: api.quoteviral.online/*
- **Frontend**: https://8163f40d.quoteviral-frontend.pages.dev
- **Temporary Alias**: https://imageworkingperfect.quoteviral-frontend.pages.dev

### Planned Access Points

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: Incorrect Images Binding Type
- **Problem**: Worker deployment failed due to incorrect binding type
- **Solution**: Changed "Images" to "images" in wrangler.toml
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Missing R2 Buckets
- **Problem**: Worker deployment failed due to missing R2 buckets
- **Solution**: Created required buckets using Wrangler CLI
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## Remaining Tasks

### Immediate Priority
1. [ ] Upload template assets to R2 buckets
2. [ ] Configure custom domains in Cloudflare dashboard
3. [ ] Test SSL certificate provisioning
4. [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working

### Secondary Priority
1. [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of the application
2. [ ] Validate image generation workflow
3. [ ] Test template selection and usage
4. [ ] Verify batch processing functionality

### Long-term Enhancements
1. [ ] Implement AI-powered quote suggestions
2. [ ] Add social media scheduling integration
3. [ ] Develop collaborative editing features
4. [ ] Create advanced analytics dashboard
5. [ ] Build mobile applications (iOS/Android)
6. [ ] Add additional language support

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered complete when:
- ✅ Backend worker accessible at api.quoteviral.online
- ✅ Frontend accessible at quoteviral.online
- ✅ Template assets uploaded and accessible
- ✅ All API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Image generation working end-to-end
- ✅ SSL certificates active for both domains
- ✅ Health monitoring showing all services operational

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **DNS Configuration Delays** - Custom domains may take time to propagate
2. **SSL Certificate Provisioning** - May require manual intervention
3. **Asset Upload Failures** - Large asset uploads may fail

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **API Integration Issues** - Frontend may have trouble connecting to backend
2. **Rate Limiting** - API may be rate-limited during heavy usage
3. **Browser Compatibility** - Frontend may not work in all browsers

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Performance Issues** - May need optimization after deployment
2. **Feature Bugs** - Minor bugs may be discovered during testing

## Next Actions

1. **Upload Assets**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   wrangler r2 object put quoteviral-assets/templates/ --file-path=./templates/
   wrangler r2 object put quoteviral-assets/fonts/ --file-path=./fonts/
   wrangler r2 object put quoteviral-assets/overlays/ --file-path=./overlays/
   wrangler r2 object put quoteviral-assets/frames/ --file-path=./frames/
   ```

2. **Configure DNS**:
   - Log in to Cloudflare dashboard
   - Navigate to Workers & Pages
   - Configure custom domains for both worker and frontend
   - Verify SSL certificates

3. **Test Integration**:
   - Test all API endpoints using curl or Postman
   - Verify frontend can communicate with backend
   - Test image generation workflow
   - Validate all template features
