2. Install dependencies
3. Test with `wrangler dev`
4. Deploy with `wrangler deploy`

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment
1. Install dependencies
2. Build with `npm run build`
3. Deploy to hosting platform

### Phase 4: Asset Deployment
1. Upload template assets to R2
2. Verify asset accessibility
3. Test in application

## Current Deployment Status

As of August 20, 2025:

✅ **Backend Deployment**: Successfully deployed Cloudflare Worker with all required bindings
✅ **Frontend Deployment**: Successfully deployed to Cloudflare Pages
⏳ **Asset Deployment**: Pending - Template assets need to be uploaded to R2
⏳ **DNS Configuration**: Pending - Custom domains need to be configured
⏳ **End-to-End Testing**: Pending - Full system testing required

## Best Practices

1. **Always deploy during off-peak hours** to minimize user impact
2. **Test locally first** using `wrangler dev` before deploying to production
3. **Backup current deployment** before making changes
4. **Follow the checklist** to ensure no steps are missed
5. **Monitor logs closely** after deployment
6. **Have a rollback plan** ready before deployment begins
7. **Document all changes** for future reference and troubleshooting

## Emergency Procedures

If deployment fails:
1. Check `deployment_troubleshooting.md` for known issues
2. Use `wrangler versions view` to see deployed versions
3. Use `wrangler versions deploy` to rollback to previous version
4. Document the failure in `deployment_failures.md`
5. Contact support if issue cannot be resolved

## Next Steps

1. Upload template assets to R2 buckets
2. Configure custom domains in Cloudflare dashboard
3. Perform end-to-end testing of the deployed application
4. Update documentation with final deployment status
