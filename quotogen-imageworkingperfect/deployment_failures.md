# QuoteViral Deployment Failure Tracking

## Purpose

This document tracks any failures or issues that occur during the deployment process, along with their root causes and resolutions. It serves as a reference for troubleshooting and improving future deployments.

## Failure Tracking Format

Each deployment failure will be documented in this format:

### Failure #[Number]: [Brief Description]
- **Date**: [Date when failure occurred]
- **Time**: [Time when failure occurred]
- **Component**: [Which component failed (Backend/Frontend/Assets/DNS)]
- **Deployment Step**: [Specific deployment step that failed]
- **Error Message**: [Exact error message received]
- **Root Cause**: [Analysis of what caused the failure]
- **Resolution**: [Steps taken to resolve the failure]
- **Status**: [Open/Resolved/Workaround]
- **Lessons Learned**: [What can be done differently in the future]

## Current Failures

### Failure #1: Incorrect Images Binding Type
- **Date**: August 20, 2025
- **Time**: 14:15 UTC
- **Component**: Backend (Cloudflare Worker)
- **Deployment Step**: Worker deployment
- **Error Message**: `binding IMAGES has an unknown type Images [code: 10021]`
- **Root Cause**: The Images binding type was incorrectly specified as "Images" instead of "images" in wrangler.toml
- **Resolution**: Changed the binding type from "Images" to "images" in wrangler.toml:
  ```toml
  [[unsafe.bindings]]
  name = "IMAGES"
  type = "images"
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Lessons Learned**: Cloudflare binding types are case-sensitive and must match exactly what's documented in the Cloudflare API documentation.

### Failure #2: Missing R2 Buckets
- **Date**: August 20, 2025
- **Time**: 14:05 UTC
- **Component**: Backend (Cloudflare Worker)
- **Deployment Step**: Worker deployment
- **Error Message**: `R2 bucket 'quoteviral-uploads' not found. Please use a different name and try again. [code: 10085]`
- **Root Cause**: The required R2 buckets were not created in the Cloudflare account
- **Resolution**: Created the missing R2 buckets using Wrangler CLI:
  ```bash
  wrangler r2 bucket create quoteviral-uploads
  wrangler r2 bucket create quoteviral-generated
  wrangler r2 bucket create quoteviral-templates
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Lessons Learned**: Always verify that all required resources (buckets, databases, namespaces) exist before attempting deployment.

## Potential Future Failures

### Potential Failure #1: DNS Configuration Issues
- **Component**: DNS/Routing
- **Deployment Step**: Custom domain configuration
- **Possible Error Messages**: 
  - "DNS resolution failed"
  - "SSL certificate provisioning failed"
  - "Domain not pointing to correct target"
- **Likely Root Causes**:
  - Incorrect DNS records
  - DNS propagation delays
  - SSL certificate provisioning issues
- **Planned Resolution**:
  - Verify DNS records in Cloudflare dashboard
  - Check DNS propagation with tools like dig or nslookup
  - Contact Cloudflare support for SSL certificate issues
- **Prevention**:
  - Double-check DNS records before configuration
  - Allow sufficient time for DNS propagation
  - Monitor certificate status in dashboard

### Potential Failure #2: Asset Upload Failures
- **Component**: Assets/R2
- **Deployment Step**: Template asset upload
- **Possible Error Messages**:
  - "Failed to upload to R2"
  - "R2 bucket permissions error"
  - "File size limit exceeded"
- **Likely Root Causes**:
  - Incorrect R2 bucket permissions
  - File size exceeding limits
  - Network connectivity issues
- **Planned Resolution**:
  - Check bucket permissions and CORS settings
  - Verify file sizes are within limits
  - Retry upload with better network connection
- **Prevention**:
  - Verify bucket permissions before upload
  - Check file sizes beforehand
  - Use reliable network connection for uploads

### Potential Failure #3: Frontend Integration Issues
- **Component**: Frontend/API
- **Deployment Step**: End-to-end testing
- **Possible Error Messages**:
  - "API endpoints not accessible"
  - "CORS policy blocked"
  - "Failed to fetch template assets"
- **Likely Root Causes**:
  - Incorrect API endpoint URLs
  - CORS configuration issues
  - Missing or incorrect headers
- **Planned Resolution**:
  - Verify API endpoint URLs in frontend configuration
  - Check CORS headers in backend responses
  - Ensure all required headers are present
- **Prevention**:
  - Test API endpoints individually before integration
  - Verify CORS configuration during development
  - Use consistent environment variables for API URLs

## Recovery Procedures

### Immediate Rollback
If deployment causes critical issues affecting users:
1. Identify the failing component
2. Document the failure symptoms and impact
3. Preserve current state for debugging (take screenshots, save logs)
4. Execute rollback procedure:
   - For Workers: `wrangler versions view` to see versions, then `wrangler versions deploy` to rollback
   - For Pages: Use Cloudflare dashboard to rollback to previous deployment
5. Verify system functionality after rollback
6. Schedule redeployment after issue resolution

### Contact Support
For issues that cannot be resolved internally:
1. Gather all error messages and logs
2. Prepare detailed description of the issue including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Time of occurrence
   - Affected components
3. Contact Cloudflare support with:
   - Account ID
   - Zone ID
   - Worker name
   - Error messages
   - Timestamps
   - Recent changes made

## Prevention Best Practices

1. **Always test locally** before deploying to production using `wrangler dev`
2. **Backup current deployment** before making changes
3. **Deploy during off-peak hours** to minimize user impact
4. **Monitor logs closely** after deployment
5. **Have a rollback plan** ready before deployment begins
6. **Document all changes** for future reference and troubleshooting
7. **Verify all environment variables** before deployment
8. **Test all API endpoints** after deployment
9. **Check resource availability** (buckets, databases, namespaces) before deployment
10. **Validate configuration files** (wrangler.toml) before deployment

## Recent Updates

This document was last updated on August 20, 2025, after successfully resolving the initial deployment failures. The backend and frontend have been deployed successfully, and we're now moving to the asset upload and DNS configuration phases.
